# Data-Wrangling-Visualization-with-Seaborn
This project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of the famous Iris dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in Jupyter Notebook. We'll explore the relationships between different flower species and their sepal/petal measurements.
